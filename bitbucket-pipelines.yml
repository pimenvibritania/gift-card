# Template PHP Web Application to deploy to the Google App Engine Standard Environment

# This template allows you to deploy your PHP Web Application to Google App Engine.
# The workflow allows running tests, code linting and security scans on feature branches (as well as master).
# The PHP Web Application will be tested and deployed after the code is merged to master.

# Prerequisites: $PROJECT, $KEY_FILE setup in the Deployment variables
# For advanced cases, please, follow examples from the google-app-engine pipe's README https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/google-app-engine-deploy/src/master/README.md
